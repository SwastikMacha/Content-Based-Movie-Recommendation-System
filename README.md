# 🎬 Content-Based Movie Recommendation System

A personalized **Movie Recommender System** built using **Content-Based Filtering** and deployed with **Streamlit**.  
The app suggests similar movies based on the metadata (genres, keywords, cast, crew, and overview) of a selected movie and enriches results with posters and details from the **TMDB API**.
